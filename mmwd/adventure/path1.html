        <p>Following the ancient stone markers, you and your team carefully navigate through the dense jungle. The markers are weathered but clearly point towards something significant.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, you notice two distinct paths emerging from the markers.</p>
        <p>Which route do you choose?</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="path3.html">Take the path with more recent disturbances</a></li>
            <li><a href="path4.html">Follow the path with older, more mysterious markings</a></li>
        </ul>
