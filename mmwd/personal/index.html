        <h3>I enjoy 3D or physical art forms rather than 2D art forms or art drawn on paper. </h3>
        <p>If <strong>I</strong> could do any style of artwork it would have to be with a fabric medium. I <strong>love</strong> doing <strong>t</strong>ie dye and sewing fabric int<strong>o</strong> things you can wear and <strong>accesorize</strong>.</p>
        <h4>Some of my favorite classes have been, Anthropology with Mr. Showalter, Introduction to Art and Sculpture 1 with Mrs. Rossi, and Womens Studies with Mrs. Lisa Self-Smith.<br> In the futrue I hope to take Fashion and Design 2 with Mrs. Denlinger and the small business style classes provided by the business department.</h4>
